Selenium Wrapper is a Python wrapper around the <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium web testing framework</a>. Selenium Wrapper was created as part of my co-op with Monsanto to assist my team in load testing websites where WebLOAD was not properly recording all data. This project wraps many headless PhantomJS instances to run a recorded and converted script to load test a website. The instances of Selenium Wrapper can then be configured to report upstream to Splunk, which aggregates and reports data. More details <a href="http://brhoades.github.io/selenium_wrapper/">here</a>.
