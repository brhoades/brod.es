      Looking for opportunities, especially early-stage, that align with my personal values.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a software generalist that thrives in ambiguity. I've been fortunate to have roles that consistently reinforce a core belief: software engineering is ultimately a people business. I lean toward growth-minded organizations that put an emphasis on their people. My professional mission is to add business value, foster team communication, provide technical insight, and ultimately enable the business to reach great outcomes.

    <p>If I were asked to “tell me about yourself” in an interview, I would begin with my hometown. I grew up in a small town of 161, Blue Eye, Missouri and it heavily influenced how I see education and learning. I attended the same, small school for 13 years and graduated in its largest-ever class of 76 students.</p>

    <p>With a small school, I lacked opportunity for a formal introduction into computer science. In 8th grade, I was really into RuneScape but became bored with actually playing it. I joined an online community that wrote bots to play the game for them where I learned my first programming language, Pascal.</p>

    <p>
      In High School, I became co-owner of Knights of Reason, a gaming community centered around a game Tremulous. Over the next 4 years, I learned much of my management fundamentals and people skills from structuring, discipling, and leading a group of 40 diverse individuals from around the globe. I built complex tools in PHP / Bash which assisted in this: KoRPS and KoRMS, which enabled democratic voting of members into our group.
