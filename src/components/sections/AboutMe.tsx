      <strong>2023: I'm available for hire!</strong><br/> Please <a href="mailto:me@brod.es">reach out</a> if the below messaging resonates with expectations for a staff
      engineer role at your company.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a flexible software engineer that thrives in ambiguity. Roles throughout my career have reinforced a core principle: software engineering is ultimately a
        people business. Which is fortunate as people are my strength; I naturally (and often subconsciously) excel in bonding and growing folks around me.
        Through growth, I connect with my coworkers by listening. And in something like an upward spiral, I create clarity, foster team communication, provide
        technical insight, and ultimately enable them to reach great outcomes <em>without me</em>.
    </p>

    <p>If I were asked to “tell me about yourself” in an interview, I would begin with my hometown. I grew up in a small town of 161, Blue Eye, Missouri and it heavily influenced how I see education and learning. I attended the same, small school for 13 years and graduated in its largest-ever class of 76 students.</p>

    <p>With a small school, I lacked opportunity for a formal introduction into computer science. In 8th grade, I was really into RuneScape but became bored with actually playing it. I joined an online community that wrote bots to play the game for them where I learned my first programming language, Pascal.</p>

    <p>
      In High School, I became co-owner of Knights of Reason, a gaming community centered around a game Tremulous. Over the next 4 years, I learned much of my management fundamentals and people skills from structuring, discipling, and leading a group of 40 diverse individuals from around the globe. I built complex tools in PHP / Bash which assisted in this: KoRPS and KoRMS, which enabled democratic voting of members into our group.
