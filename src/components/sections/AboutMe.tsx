        I like programming--- no, seriously, I <em>like</em> programming. I program as a hobby: both after work and on the weekends. Currently TypeScript is my favorite language, but Python follows as a close second. I am also passionate about good management; both above me and under me. Read <a href="https://blog.brod.es/management/2019/07/29/one-on-ones.html">my blog</a> about 1-on-1s and see how I tick.

    <p>If I were asked to “tell me about yourself” in an interview, I would begin with my hometown. I grew up in a small town of 161, Blue Eye, Missouri and it heavily influenced how I see education and learning. I attended the same, small school for 13 years and graduated in its largest-ever class of 76 students.</p>

    <p>With a small school, I had no opportunity for a introduction into computer science. In 8th grade, I was really into RuneScape but became bored with actually playing it. I joined an online community that wrote bots to play the game for them; from this, I learned my first programming language, Pascal.</p>

      In High School, I became co-owner of Knights of Reason: a gaming community centered around a game Tremulous. Over the next 4 years, I learned the majority of my management and people skills from structuring, discipling, and leading a group of 40 individuals around the globe. I built complex tools in PHP / Bash which assisted in this: KoRPS and KoRMS, which enabled democratic voting in / out of members to our group.

      <p>I was fortunate to have discovered Linux in 8th grade. I did not know what to make of it then, but something about it stuck with me. A year later and I had it on my home computer. Fast forward three years and my desktop and laptop both ran Arch Linux, with the latter not even having a Windows install. 10+ years later, all my personal machines still run some variant of Linux as the primary OS.</p>
